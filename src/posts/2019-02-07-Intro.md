This is a blog. It's (hopefully) going to document the progress on my Term 1 project, and maybe other projects going forwards. It's built on a program that I wrote called [cmx2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cmx2), and it's hosted on [now](https://now.sh).

# Intro to my game
My game cheats. Instead of going full text-based, I've made a renderer for full colour, which means that I can put images in. I'm planning to make the game in a way that each room is 1 screen, and I won't re-render 60 times a second or something. In the end this might be a shit idea, but for now it'll do.

Like most text-based RPGs, you don't walk around. There'll be a series of options at the bottom of the screen which you can use
